In this section, I explored the data further and will document interesting insights I came across. 

NOTE: The concern about the -9 and '?' entries persists. If I choose to drop variables studying the Thalassemia and FCV
variables, I could end up with a total of 600 observations. Whether this is appropriate for the analysis to be conducted
is another questions. The predicting valriabe should be a 0,1 variable, however, there are 135 entries of 2.0 and 3.0 and
43 entries in 4.0. This is a concern. 

The mean patient age distribution is between the ages of 55 and 60 according to the data.
A scatter plot measuring age against resting blood pressure shows that the older the patient is, the more likely 
their blood pressure is to be higher. 
A gender analysis on resting blood pressure shows that men are more likely to have higher average blood pressure readings
compared to women. 
Another analysis by gender shows that women are more likely to have higher serum cholesterol level readings than men on
average. 
Additionally, men are more likely to have excercise induced angina than women. 
On average, men are more likely to have 50% of their major coronoary heart vessel blocked compared to women. 
The resting blood pressure seems consistent with all patients, whether or not they have 50% of a major coronary vessel 
blocked. 
The higher a patient's serum cholesterol level, the more likely their resting blood pressure is high. 
A higher likelihood of a major coronary vessel blockage means that patient's blood pressure is likely higher. 
A study shows that the higher likelihood of a major coronary vessel blockage meant there were less patients with high 
scl levels (between 200 and 300)
