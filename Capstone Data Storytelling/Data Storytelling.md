### Data Storytelling Analysis of Data 

In this section, I explored the data further and will document interesting insights I came across. 

#### Notes on plots shown: 

##### Age 

- The mean patient age distribution is between the ages of 55 and 60 according to the data.

##### Serum Cholesterol Levels and Resting Blood Pressure

- A scatter plot shows a positive correlation between the serum cholesterol level of the patient and their resting blood pressure

##### Exercise Induced Angina and Maximum Heart Rates

- The data shows that patients who have suffered from exercise induced angina are less likely to reach higher maximum heart rates in comparison to patients that do not suffer from exercise induced angina. 

##### Coronary vessel blockage and maximum heart rates 

- Similarly, patients who are more likely to have coronary artery blockages are less likely to reach higher maximum heart rates

##### Gender and Resting Blood Pressure

- A gender analysis shows that a lot more men have higher resting blood pressure measures compared to women (between 110 and 160)

##### Coronary Artery Blockage and Resting Blood Pressure

- Patients with and without coronary artery blockages are likely to have the same average resting blood pressure 

##### Chest Pains and Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

- Patients with asymptomatic chest pains have the lowest average maximum heart rates achieved when induced under stress

Note - patients that struggle to reach high maximum heart rates under stress suffer from an exercise induced angina and therefore cannot maintain a higher heart rate without pain. 

##### Chest Pains and Resting Blood Pressure

- Patients with asymptomatic chest pains are also the most likely to suffer from high resting blood pressure measures. 

##### Electrocardiographic Results and Resting Blood Pressure

- Majority of patients that reported with normal resting electrocardiographic results also had high resting blood pressures. The distribution decreases as results begin to indicated some sort of abnormality, however, the resting blood pressure measures are still high.

##### Subplots Analysis by Gender

- After producing a couple of subplots doing an analysis by gender, we see that men are more likely to have a higher resting blood pressure than women, however, the distribution by gender of serum cholesterol levels are fairly similar.
