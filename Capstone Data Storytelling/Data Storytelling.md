In this section, I explored the data further and will document interesting insights I came across. 

Notes on plots: 

- The mean patient age distribution is between the ages of 55 and 60 according to the data.

- A scatter plot shows a positive correlation between the serum cholesterol level of the patient and their resting blood pressure

- The data shows that patients who have suffered from exercise induced angina are less likely to reach higher maximum heart rates in comparison to patients that do not suffer from exercise induced angina. 

- Similarly, patients who are more likely to have coronary artery blockages are less likely to reach higher maximum heart rates

- A gender analysis shows that a lot more men have higher resting blood pressure measures compared to women (between 110 and 160)

- Patients with and without coronary artery blockages are likely to have the same average resting blood pressure 

- Patients with asymptomatic chest pains have the lowest average maximum heart rates achieved when induced under stress

Note - patients that struggle to reach high maximum heart rates under stress suffer from an exercise induced angina and therefore cannot maintain a higher heart rate without pain. 

- Patients with asymptomatic chest pains are also the most likely to suffer from high resting blood pressure measures. 

- Majority of patients that reported with normal resting electrocardiographic results also had high resting blood pressures. The distribution decreases as results begin to indicated some sort of abnormality, however, the resting blood pressure measures are still high.
