## Brief of Analysis: 

In this section, we conduct some inferential statistics of the data. 

#### Grouping the data by predicting variable DHD, whether a patient has a major coronary artery blocked or not

After grouping the data by whether the patient has at least one blockage in a major coronary vessel, we see that patients with certain attributes are more likely to have a blockage in one of their major coronary vessels:*

1. Older patients
2. Patients with chest pains that are closer to asymptomatic 
3. Patients with a higher resting blood pressure 
4. Patients with higher serum cholesterol levels 
5. Patients with abnormalities in their resting electrocardiographic results 
6. Patients that managed a lower maximum heart rate under stress
7. Patients that suffer with exercise induced angina 

#### Gender Analaysis of Data

First of all, I calculated a gender calculation to have a better understanding of the proportion of males and females in our dataset. 
I also calculated the ratio of patients that suffer from at least one major coronary vessel artery blockage. These patients are the majority in the dataset. 

I also tested whether the average that a male patient may suffer from blocked coronary vessel was the same as the average of that of a female patient. 

#### Blood Pressure Analysis of Data

Moreover, I sliced the dataset based on above average and below average resting blood pressure measures. I proceeded to calculate whether the mean of patients may have suffered from a blocked coronary vessel were the same for high blood pressure and low blood pressure groups. 

#### Electrocardiographic Analysis of Data 

Additionally, I proceeded to categorize the dataframe into normal and abnormal electrocardiographic results, and tested whether the mean of patients that may have suffered from a blocked coronary vessel may have differed between both groups. 

I also tested whether the average that a male patient may suffer from blocked coronary vessel was the same as the average of that of a female patient. 

#### Exercise Induced Angina Analysis of Data 

Finally, I looked at whether the patients' average exercise induced angina differed between high blood pressure and low blood pressure groups.

#### Conclusion

In all the cases above, we rejected the null hypothesis that the means were the same for each group and we observed extremely low p values for all measures. However, it is worth noting that the analysis done with regards to electrocardiographic results shows that the means, although different, are close.
